# Simulation HW 1

I this project i have tried to simulate probabilistic models and illustrating statistical principles.

## Question 1

In this i modelled a coin that gives heads with a certain probability as a Bernoulli random variable. We perform the following tasks: (a) Simulate and plot 
ùëõ
n coin tosses to observe the outcomes; (b) Repeat the simulation 5 times and plot all outcomes on the same figure to compare variability; (c) Repeat the simulation 
ùëö
m times, store the sequences, calculate the total number of heads, and plot their histogram to approximate the binomial PMF; and (d) Select sequences from Part (c) that sum to at least 
k, recalculate the number of heads, and plot their histogram to observe changes in the PMF.



## Question 2
- **Task:** Simulate binomial and Poisson distributions for four randomly chosen \( \lambda \) values.
- **Implementation:** Chose \( \lambda \) values, simulated distributions, and compared PMFs.

## Question 3
- **Task:** Illustrate the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem for sums of i.i.d. Poisson RVs.
- **Implementation:** Chose \( \lambda \) values, simulated sums of Poisson RVs, and demonstrated convergence to a normal distribution.
